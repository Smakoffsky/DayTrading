# DayTrading
This my day trading journal, ideas, trades and comments 

*2024-04-04*
It's happened that my day trading journey has been hard this past 6 months. 2023 was good till October. That's when I made a big mistake in stocks and decided to stop trading stocks and learn more options trading.
There were ups and downs, but the last two months these were mostly downs.
That's why I decided that it's time for a BIG change.

My plan is: to build discipline in making decisitions and following the plan, calculate risk reward.
